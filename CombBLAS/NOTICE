This repository contains a modified version of the Combinatorial BLAS (CombBLAS) library.

Modifications in this repository (CombBLAS-HipPerm):
  - Added the HipPerm framework for distributed sparse matrix operations:
      * HipPerm: permutation of rows/columns in sparse matrices
      * HipExtract: extraction of submatrices
      * HipAssign: assignment of sparse submatrices into larger distributed matrices
  - Build system simplified: removed `_install/` logic from CMake

All original rights, terms, and conditions from CombBLAS remain in effect (see LICENSE).
This repository is not an official release of the CombBLAS project.
